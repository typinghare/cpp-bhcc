 * Modify the Box class (topic 6 reading assignment):
 * 1. create overloaded comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, !=, ==).
 * 2. create an overloaded addition operator. for the addition operator to work, a side on each box
 * must be the same (l and w, l and h, or h and w).
 * 3. create an overloaded subtraction operator. for the subtraction operator to work, a side on
 * each box must be the same (l and w, l and h, or h and w), and the RHS of the subtraction must be
 * smaller than the LHS. (Think of cutting off a section of a 2x4 length of lumber).
 * 4. create overloaded stream input and output operators.
 * NOTE: in the stream input overload, do NOT use cout to get the values from the user...
